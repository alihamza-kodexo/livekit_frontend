/**
 * The FSD Section 4.3 tuning parameters, with the ranges the action enforces.
 *
 * `appliesTo` is the honest answer to "does moving this actually change a

 *
 *  - "all"      -- reaches every engine, though not always by the same route.
 *                  temperature and max_reply_sentences go into the
 *                  model/prompt. The two turn-taking values go into
 *                  AgentSession's TurnHandlingOptions on the STT/LLM/TTS
 *                  pipeline, but a realtime model owns turn-taking outright and
 *                  discards those options, so for Gemini Live the worker
 *                  translates them into Gemini's own activity-detection config
 *                  instead -- same intent, different mechanism and slightly
 *                  different units. `realtimeNote` spells out the difference on
 *                  the field itself; see entrypoint.py
 *                  `_gemini_activity_detection`.
 *  - "none"     -- stored, but nothing consumes it today. Deepgram Aura exposes
 *                  no stability or rate control and the worker has no
 *                  backchannel behaviour, so these are placeholders for a TTS
 *                  vendor that supports them.
