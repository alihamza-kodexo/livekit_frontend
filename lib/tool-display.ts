 * Icon and accent colour per tool type.
 *
 * Keyed by type alone rather than derived from a Tool, so the type picker in
 * tool-form.tsx can show the same mark as the library list -- when creating a
 * tool there is no row yet to read it from. One source for both is the point:
 * a type that looks different in the picker than in the list is worse than no
 * icon at all.
 *
 * Colours are semantic where a type has an obvious reading -- green for capture,
 * blue for routing, amber and red for the two that end calls -- and the pair of
 * detectors are deliberately different from each other, since "an automated
 * system answered" and "a human is selling to us" are different problems.
